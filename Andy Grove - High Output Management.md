	1. manufacturing
	2. assembly
	3. testing
2. Measure what's happening
	- quantitative, output-oriented, leading indicator
3. Output of management = output of all groups in influence management
	-  Leverage -> positively influence as many people for as long in as little time
4. Meetings are the medium of work
	- process-oriented: staff, one-on-one, operation review
	- mission-oriented: ad-hoc, chairman manages to take decision, should only be around 1 in 5 meetings
5. Decision making
	- between technical expertise and operational experience
	- peer-plus-one approach
	- gather all information, let everyone be heard and then decide
6. Planning
	- Future oriented: What do I have to do today to avoid tomorrow's problems?
	- Where to go? -> Objective
	- How to know whether you're there? -> Key results
	- one person's objective (build factory in X) becomes another person's key result (ensure manufacturing in region Y)
7. Scaling
	- management not only team game but game of team of teams
8. Hybrid Organization
	-  mission-oriented (fractal -> solve local problems)
	-  functional (economies of scale)
	-  effectively always striving to become purely functional but in practice hybrid due to local environmental demands
9. Dual Reporting
	- everybody reports both to their supervisor (mission-oriented) and to a group of peers (functional)
10. Modes of control
	- Free Market -> Contractual Obligations -> Cultural Values (with increasing group interest and increasing CUA (complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity))

	- Peter principle (employee gets promoted until not high enough TRM to excel at position)
	- Recycle employee in position with matching TRM, no failure
13. Performance review
	- high leverage
	- get employee to assume responsibility and find solution to problems
14. Hiring and keeping employees

## I The Breakfast Factory

### 1 The Basics of Production: Delivering a Breakfast (or a College Graduate, or a Compiler, or a Convicted Criminal…)

We planned our flow around the most critical step—the time required to boil the egg—and we staggered each of the other steps according to individual throughput times; again in production jargon, we offset them from each other.

==Making the eggs is the limiting step.==

Other production principles underlie the preparation of our breakfast. In the making of it, we find present the three fundamental types of production operations: 
- ==process manufacturing==, an activity that physically or chemically changes material just as boiling changes an egg; 
- ==assembly==, in which components are put together to constitute a new entity just as the egg, the toast, and the coffee together make a breakfast;
- and ==test==, which subjects the components or the total to an examination of its characteristics. There are, for example, visual tests made at points in the breakfast production process: you can see that the coffee is steaming and that the toast is brown.

Breakfast preparation, college recruiting, sales training, and compiler design are very much unlike one another, but all of them possess a basically similar flow of activity to produce a specific output.

With limited toaster capacity, making the toast becomes the limiting step.

As the manager, you could add another toaster, but this becomes an expensive addition of capital equipment. You could run the toaster continuously and build up an inventory of hot toast, throwing away what you can’t use but always having immediate access to product. That means waste, which can also become too expensive for the operation. But at least you know that alternatives do exist: equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each other and then balanced against delivery time.

Because each alternative costs money, your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources—the key to optimizing all types of productive work

==All production flows have a basic characteristic: the material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process==. A boiled egg is more valuable than a raw one, a fully assembled breakfast is more valuable than its constituent parts, and finally, the breakfast placed in front of the customer is more valuable still

A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. Thus, we should find and reject the rotten egg as it’s being delivered from our supplier rather than permitting the customer to find it

### 2 Managing the Breakfast Factory

As manager of the factory, you have a substantial staff and a lot of automated equipment. But to run your operation well, you will need a set of good indicators, or measurements. Your output, of course, is no longer the breakfasts you deliver personally but rather all the breakfasts your factory delivers, profits generated, and the satisfaction of your customers. Just to get a fix on your output, you need a number of indicators; to get efficiency and high output, you need even more of them. The number of possible indicators you can choose is virtually limitless, but for any set of them to be useful, you have to focus each indicator on a specific operational goal

==Indicators tend to direct your attention toward what they are monitoring. It is like riding a bicycle, you will probably steer it where you are looking.==

Because indicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting. This you can do by pairing indicators, so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. Thus, in the inventory example, you need to monitor both inventory levels and the incidence of shortages.

==The first rule is that a measurement—any measurement—is better than none. But a genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity).==

==The second criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a physical, countable thing.==

==Leading indicators give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like==

The linearity indicator can give us an early warning that we are likely to miss our target.

Also valuable are trend indicators. These show output (breakfasts delivered, software modules completed, vouchers processed) measured against time (performance this month versus performance over a series of previous months), and also against some standard or expected level. A display of trends forces you to look at the future as you are led to extrapolate almost automatically from the past.

Another sound way to anticipate the future is through the use of the stagger chart, which forecasts an output over the next several months. The chart is updated monthly, so that each month you will have an updated version of the then-current forecast information as compared to several prior forecasts

![[hom2.png]]
(* means the actual number for that month)

==Build to forecast==, which is a contemplation of future orders. To do this, the manufacturer sets up his activities around a reasoned speculation that orders will materialize for specific products within a certain time.

Delivering a product that was built to forecast to a customer consists of two simultaneous processes, each with a separate time cycle. A manufacturing flow must occur in which the raw material move through various production steps and finally enters the finished goods warehouse, as illustrated below. Simultaneously, a salesman finds a prospect and sells to that prospect, who eventually places an order with the manufacturer. Ideally, the order for the product and the product itself should arrive on the shipping dock at the same time.

==The order for the product and the product itself should arrive at the shipping dock at the same time==

Clearly, the more inventory we have, the more change we can cope with and still satisfy orders. But inventory costs money to build and keep, and therefore should be controlled carefully. Ideally, inventory should be kept at the lowest-value stage, as we’ve learned before, like raw eggs kept at the breakfast factory. Also, the lower the value, the more production flexibility we obtain for a given inventory cost.

In the language of production, the lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect raw material is called incoming material inspection or receiving inspection.

inspections that occur at intervening points within it are called, logically enough, in-process inspections. Finally, the last possible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is called final inspection or outgoing quality inspection.

==The key principle is to reject the defective “material” at its lowest-value stage.==

While in most instances the decision to accept or reject defective material at a given inspection point is an economic one, one should never let substandard material proceed when its defects could cause a complete failure—a reliability problem—for our customer.

There is a gate-like inspection and a monitoring step. In the former, all material is held at the “gate” until the inspection tests are completed. If the material passes, it is moved on to the next stage in the production process; if the material fails, it will be returned to an earlier stage, where it will be reworked or scrapped. In the latter, a sample of the material is taken, and if it fails, a notation is made from which a failure rate is calculated. The bulk of the material is not held as the sample is taken but continues to move through the manufacturing process

A monitor produces no comparable slowdown but might let some bad material escape before we can act on the monitor’s results and shut things down, which means that we might have to reject material later at a higher-value stage.

Another way to lower the cost of quality assurance is to use variable inspections. Because quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we inspect

The productivity of any function occurring within it is the output divided by the labor required to generate the output. Thus, one way to increase productivity is to do whatever we are now doing, but faster. This could be done by reorganizing the work are or just by working harder

There is a second way to improve productivity. We can change the nature of the work performed: what we do, not how fast we do it. We want to increase the ratio of output to activity, thereby increasing output even if the activity per employee-hour remains the same. As the slogan has it, we want to “work smarter, not harder.”

![[hom3.png]]
Productivity can be increased by performing the work activities at a higher rate…

![[hom4.png]]
…or by increasing the leverage of the activities

==**Leverage**, which is the output generated by a specific type of work activity==. An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output.

To get leverage this way, you first need to create a flow chart of the production process as it exists. Every single step must be shown on it; no step should be omitted in order to pretty things up on paper. Second, count the number of steps in the flow chart so that you know how many you started with. Third, set a rough target for reduction of the number of steps. In the first round of work simplification, our experience shows that you can reasonably expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction.

As we will see, in the work of the soft professions, it becomes very difficult to distinguish between output and activity. And as noted, stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.

## II Management Is a Team Game

### 3 Managerial Leverage

==A manager’s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence==

the definition of “manager” should be broadened: individual contributors who gather and disseminate know-how and information should also be seen as middle managers, because they exert great power within the organization.

While the manager’s own work is clearly very important, that in itself does not create output. Her organization does. By analogy, a coach or a quarterback alone does not score touchdowns and win games. Entire teams with their participation and guidance and direction do.

==My day always ends when I’m tired and ready to go home, not when I’m done. I am never done. Like a housewife’s, a manager’s work is never done. There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done.==

==A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. In other words, he should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest==

I have to confess that the information most useful to me, and I suspect most useful to all managers, comes from quick, often casual verbal exchanges. This usually reaches a manager much faster than anything written down. And usually the more timely the information, the more valuable it is.

So why are written reports necessary at all? They obviously can’t provide timely information. What they do is constitute an archive of data, help to validate ad hoc inputs, and catch, in safety-net fashion, anything you may have missed. But reports also have another totally different function. As they are formulated and written, the author is forced to be more precise than he might be verbally

As can be seen from my schedule, a ==manager not only gathers information but is also a source of it==. He must convey his knowledge to members of his own organization and to other groups he influences. Beyond relaying facts, a manager must also communicate his objectives, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are approached

The third major kind of managerial activity, of course, is ==decision-making==. To be sure, once in a while we managers in fact make a decision. But for every time that happens, we participate in the making of many, many others, and we do that in a variety of ways. We provide factual inputs or just offer opinions, we debate the pros and cons of alternatives and thereby force a better decision to emerge, we review decisions made or about to be made by others, encourage or discourage them, ratify or veto them.

==“nudging”== because through it you nudge an individual or a meeting in the direction you would like. This is an immensely important managerial activity in which we engage all the time, and it should be carefully distinguished from decision-making that results in firm, clear directives. In reality, for every unambiguous decision we make, we probably nudge things a dozen times.

Finally, something more subtle pervades the day of all managers. While we move about, doing what we regard as our jobs, we are ==role models== for people in our organization—our subordinates, our peers, and even our supervisors

==Values and behavioral norms are simply not transmitted easily by talk or memo, but are conveyed very effectively by doing and doing visibly==

In principle more money, more manpower, or more capital can always be made available, but our own time is the one absolutely finite resource we each have. Its allocation and use therefore deserve considerable attention. How you handle your own time is, in my view, the single most important aspect of being a role model and leader.

==Leverage is the measure of the output generated by any given managerial activity==

Managerial Output = Output of organization   = L1 × A1 + L2 × A2 +…

HIGH-LEVERAGE ACTIVITIES 

These can be achieved in three basic ways: 
•  When ==many people== are affected by one manager. 
•  When a person’s activity or behavior ==over a long period of time== is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of words or actions. 
•  When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a ==unique, key piece of knowledge or information==.

Because managerial time has a hierarchy of values, delegation is an essential aspect of management. The “delegator” and “delegatee” must share a common information base and a common set of operational ideas or notions on how to go about solving problems, a requirement that is frequently not met. Unless both parties share the relevant common base, the delegatee can become an effective proxy only with specific instructions. As in meddling, where specific activities are prescribed in detail, this produces low managerial leverage.

==Delegation without follow-through is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result. Monitoring is not meddling, but means checking to make sure an activity is proceeding in line with expectations==

From my experience a large portion of managerial work can be forecasted. Accordingly, forecasting those things you can and setting yourself up to do them is only common sense and an important way to minimize the feeling and the reality of fragmentation experienced in managerial work. Forecasting and planning your time around key events are literally like running an efficient factory.

To ==use your calendar as a production-planning tool==, you must accept responsibility for two things: 
1. You should move toward the active use of your calendar, taking the initiative to fill the holes between the time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities.
2. You should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.

As a rule of thumb, a manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to eight subordinates; three or four are too few and ten are too many. This range comes from a guideline that a manager should allocate about a half day per week to each of his subordinates. (Two days a week per subordinate would probably lead to meddling; an hour a week does not provide enough opportunity for monitoring.)

Manufacturers turn out standard products. By analogy, if you can pin down what kind of interruptions you’re getting, you can ==prepare standard responses for those that pop up most often==.

Also, if you ==use the production principle of batching== —that is, handling a group of similar chores at one time—many interruptions that come from your subordinates can be accumulated and handled not randomly, but at staff and at one-on-one

### 4 Meetings—The Medium of Managerial Work

#### Process-Oriented Meetings

To make the most of this kind of meeting, we should aim to ==infuse it with regularity. In other words, the people attending should know how the meeting is run, what kinds of substantive matters are discussed, and what is to be accomplished==. It should be designed to allow a manager to “batch” transactions, to use the same “production” set-up time and effort to take care of many similar managerial tasks. Moreover, given the regularity, you and the others attending can begin to forecast the time required for the kinds of work to be done. Hence, a “production control” system, as recorded on various calendars, can take shape, which means that a scheduled meeting will have minimum impact on other things people are doing.

ONE-ON-ONES

At Intel, a one-on-one is a meeting between a supervisor and a subordinate, and it is the principal way their business relationship is maintained. Its main purpose is mutual teaching and exchange of information. ==By talking about specific problems and situations, the supervisor teaches the subordinate his skills and know-how, and suggests ways to approach things. At the same time, the subordinate provides the supervisor with detailed information about what he is doing and what he is concerned about==.

An outline also provides a framework for supporting information, which the subordinate should prepare in advance. The subordinate should then walk the supervisor through all the material.

Many issues in a one-on-one lead to action required on the part of the subordinate. When he takes a note immediately following the supervisor’s suggestion, the act implies a commitment, like a handshake, that something will be done. The supervisor, also having taken notes, can then follow up at the next one-on-one.

STAFF MEETINGS

==A staff meeting is one in which a supervisor and all of his subordinates participate, and which therefore presents an opportunity for interaction among peers.==

==Staff meetings also create opportunities for the supervisor to learn from the exchange and confrontation that often develops.==

What should be discussed at a staff meeting? Anything that affects more than two of the people present. If the meeting degenerates into a conversation between two people working on a problem affecting only them, the supervisor should break it off and move on to something else that will include more of the staff, while suggesting that the two continue their exchange later.

What is the role of the supervisor in the staff meeting—a leader, observer, expediter, questioner, decision-maker? The answer, of course, is all of them. Please note that lecturer is not listed. A supervisor should never use staff meetings to pontificate, which is the surest way to undermine free discussion and hence the meeting’s basic purpose.

The supervisor’s effort at a staff meeting should go into keeping the discussion on track, with the subordinates bearing the brunt of working the issues.

OPERATION REVIEWS

==This is the medium of interaction for people who don’t otherwise have much opportunity to deal with one another. The format here should include formal presentations in which managers describe their work to other managers who are not their immediate supervisors, and to peers in other parts of the company.==

The audience at an operation review also has a crucial part to play. One of the distinguishing marks of a good meeting is that the audience participates by asking questions and making comments. If you avoid the presenter’s eyes, yawn, or read the newspaper it’s worse than not being there at all.

#### Mission-Oriented Meetings

Unlike a process-oriented meeting, which is a regularly scheduled affair held to exchange knowledge and information, ==the mission-oriented meeting is usually held ad hoc and is designed to produce a specific output, frequently a decision. The key to success here is what the chairman does==. Very often no one is officially given that title, but by whatever name, one person usually has more at stake in the outcome of the meeting than others. In fact, it is usually the chairman or the de facto chairman who calls the meeting, and most of what he contributes should occur before it begins.

Keep in mind that a meeting called to make a specific decision is hard to keep moving if more than six or seven people attend. Eight people should be the absolute cutoff. ==Decision-making is not a spectator sport, because onlookers get in the way of what needs to be done.==

==Once the meeting is over, the chairman must nail down exactly what happened by sending out minutes that summarize the discussion that occurred, the decision made, and the actions to be taken==. And it’s very important that attendees get the minutes quickly, before they forget what happened. The minutes should also be as clear and as specific as possible, telling the reader what is to be done, who is to do it, and when. All this may seem like too much trouble, but if the meeting was worth calling in the first place, the work needed to produce the minutes is a small additional investment (an activity with high leverage) to ensure that the full benefit is obtained from what was done.

Ideally, a manager should never have to call an ad hoc, mission-oriented meeting, because if all runs smoothly, everything is taken care of in regularly scheduled, process-oriented meetings. In practice, however, ==if all goes well, routine meetings will take care of maybe 80 percent of the problems and issues; the remaining 20 percent will still have to be dealt with in mission-oriented==

### 5 Decisions, Decisions

In traditional industries, where the management chain of command was precisely defined, a person making a certain kind of decision was a person occupying a particular position in the organization chart. As the saying went, authority (to make decisions) went with responsibility (position in the management hierarchy).

However, in businesses that mostly deal with information and know-how, a manager has to cope with a new phenomenon. Here a rapid divergence develops between power based on position and power based on knowledge, which occurs because the base of knowledge that constitutes the foundation of the business changes rapidly.

==Ideally, decision-making should occur in the middle ground, between reliance on technical knowledge on the one hand, and on the bruises one has received from having tried to implement and apply such knowledge on the other. To make a decision, if you can’t find people with both qualities, you should aim to get the best possible mix of participants available.==

==Peer-plus-one approach==, and have used it since then to aid decision-making where we must. Peers tend to look for a more senior manager, even if he is not the most competent or knowledgeable person involved, to take over and shape a meeting.

You can overcome the peer-group syndrome if each of the members has self-confidence, which stems in part from being familiar with the issue under consideration and from experience. But in the end self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled. And everyone in your operation should be made to understand this.

If the peer-group syndrome manifests itself, and the meeting has no formal chairman, the person who has the most at stake should take charge. If that doesn’t work, one can always ask the senior person present to assume control. He is likely to be no more expert in the issues at hand than other members of the group—perhaps less expert—but he is likely to act as a godfather, a repository of knowledge about how decisions should be made, and give the group the confidence needed to make a decision.

If you either enter the decision-making stage too early or wait too long, you won’t derive the full benefit of open discussion. ==The criterion to follow is this: don’t push for a decision prematurely. Make sure you have heard and considered the real issues rather than the superficial comments that often dominate the early part of a meeting. But if you feel that you have already heard everything, that all sides of the issue have been raised, it is time to push for a consensus—and failing that, to step in and make a decision.==

Basically, like other things managers do, decision-making has an output associated with it, which in this case is the decision itself. Like other managerial processes, ==decision-making is likelier to generate high-quality output in a timely fashion if we say clearly at the outset that we expect exactly that==. In other words, one of the manager’s key tasks is to settle six important questions in advance: 
• What decision needs to be made? 
• When does it have to be made? 
• Who will decide? 
• Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision? 
• Who will ratify or veto the decision? 
• Who will need to be informed of the decision?

If the veto comes as a surprise, however legitimate it may have been on its merits, an impression of political maneuvering is inevitably created. Politics and manipulation or even their appearance should be avoided at all costs. And I can think of no better way to make the decision-making process straightforward than to apply before the fact the structure imposed by our six questions.

### 6 Planning: Today’s Actions for Tomorrow’s Output

STEP 1—ENVIRONMENTAL DEMAND

You need to focus on the difference between what your environment demands from you now and what you expect it to demand from you a year from now. Such a difference analysis is crucial, because if your current activities satisfy the current demands placed on your business, anything more and new should be undertaken to match this difference. How you react to this difference is in fact the key outcome of the planning process.

STEP 2—PRESENT STATUS

listing your present capabilities and the projects you have in the works. As you account for them, be sure to use the same terms, or “currency,” in which you stated demand. For instance, if your demand is listed in terms of completed product designs, your work-in-process should be listed as partially completed product designs. You also need to look at timing; namely, when will these projects come out of your “pipeline”? You must ask yourself, will every project now moving through be completed?

STEP 3—WHAT TO DO TO CLOSE THE GAP

The final step of planning consists of undertaking new tasks or modifying old ones to close the gap between your environmental demand and what your present activities will yield. The first question is, What do you need to do to close the gap? The second is, What can you do to close the gap? Consider each question separately, and then decide what you actually will do, evaluating what effect your actions will have on narrowing the gap, and when. The set of actions you decide upon is your strategy.

==Today’s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past. By analogy, forcing ourselves to concentrate on the decisions needed to fix today’s problem is like scurrying after our car has already run out of gas. Clearly we should have filled up earlier. To avoid such a fate, remember that as you plan you must answer the question: What do I have to do today to solve—or better, avoid— tomorrow’s problem?==

Finally, remember that by saying “yes”—to projects, a course of action, or whatever—you are implicitly saying “no” to something else. Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence of allocating any finite resource. People who plan have to have the guts, honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes.”

Management by Objectives: The Planning Process Applied to Daily Work

A successful MBO system needs only to answer two questions: 
1. ==Where do I want to go?== (The answer provides the ==objective==. ) 
2. ==How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there?== (The answer gives us milestones, or ==key results==. )

MBO is largely designed to provide feedback relevant to the specific task at hand; it should tell us how we are doing so we can make adjustments in whatever we are doing if need be, such as getting off the highway and asking for directions. For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs.

The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small.

If the supervisor mechanically relies on the MBO system to evaluate his subordinate’s performance, or if the subordinate uses it rigidly and forgoes taking advantage of an emerging opportunity because it was not a specified objective or key result, then both are behaving in a petty and unprofessional fashion.

==A manager’s objectives are supported by an appropriate set of key results. His objectives in turn are tied to his supervisor’s objectives so that if the manager meets his objectives, his supervisor will meet his==. But the MBO system cannot be run mechanically by a computer. The ==system requires judgment and common sense to set the hierarchy of objectives and the key results that support them==. Both judgment and common sense are also required when using MBO to guide you in your work from one day to the next.

## III Team of Teams

### 7 The Breakfast Factory Goes National

Things have become very complicated. Sometimes as I sit behind my big desk at corporate headquarters, I wish I could go back to the early days when I was getting the eggs and toast and pouring the coffee myself. Or if not that, at least back to the days when I was running a single Breakfast Factory, and I knew everybody by name and could make all the decisions without having to struggle with a mountain of pros and cons. Then there was virtually no overhead. Now there’s a corporate personnel manager. There’s also a traffic manager, who wants to buy a computer to optimize the flow of eggs from the regional centers to the individual franchises. He says he can minimize transportation costs while ensuring same-day delivery. He also claims that if he had this computer, he could keep the tableware inventory at the lowest possible level. It won’t be long before we’ll have a corporate manager for real estate acquisitions. Very complicated indeed.

Earlier, we established the fact that the game of management is a team game: a manager’s output is the output of the organizations under his supervision or influence. We now discover that ==management is not just a team game, it is a game in which we have to fashion a team of teams, where the various individual teams exist in some suitable and mutually supportive relationship with each other==.

### 8 Hybrid Organizations

![[hom5.png]]
The Breakfast Factory network organized in (a) totally mission-oriented and (b) totally functional forms.

The desire to give the individual branch manager the power to respond to local conditions moves us toward a mission-oriented organization. But a similarly legitimate desire to take advantage of the obvious economies of scale and to increase the leverage of the expertise we have in each operational area across the entire corporation would push us toward a functional organization. In the real world, of course, we look for a compromise between the two extremes. In fact, the search for the appropriate compromise has preoccupied managers for a long, long time. Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, “Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.” Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.

Intel is a ==hybrid organization: balancing to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.==

What are some of the advantages of organizing much of a company in a mission-oriented form? There is only one. It is that the individual units can stay in touch with the needs of their business or product areas and initiate changes rapidly when those needs change. That is it. All other considerations favor the functional-type of organization. But the business of any business is to respond to the demands and needs of its environment, and the need to be responsive is so important that it always leads to much of any organization being grouped in mission-oriented units.

Here I would like to propose Grove’s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.

### 9 Dual Reporting

==The manufacturing managers report to two supervisors: to their general managers and to a group of their peers.==

This system makes a manager’s life ambiguous, and most people don’t like ambiguity. Nevertheless, the system is needed to make hybrid organizations work, and while people will strive to find something simpler, the reality is that it doesn’t exist. A strictly functional organization, which is clear conceptually, tends to remove engineering and manufacturing (or the equivalent groups in your firm) from the marketplace, leaving them with no idea of what the customers want. A highly mission-oriented organization, in turn, may have definite crisp reporting relationships and clear and unambiguous objectives at all times. However, the fragmented state of affairs that results causes inefficiency and poor overall performance.

The controller for a business division should be supervised by both organizations.

Dual reporting can certainly tax the patience of the marketing managers, as they are now also required to understand the needs and thought processes of their peers. But no real alternative exists when you need to communicate individual product and market messages and maintain a corporate identity at the same time.

Cindy’s name appears on two organization charts—coordinating groups are a means for know-how managers to increase their leverage.

The techniques that we have to master to make hybrid organizations work—dual or multiple reporting and also decision-making by peer groups—are both necessary if such transitory teams are to work. The key factor common to all is the use of cultural values as a mode of control, which we will consider next.

### 10 Modes of Control

our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means.

#### Free-Market Forces

==The free market can easily establish a price for something as simple as tires. But for much else that changes hands in a work or business environment, value is hard to establish.==

#### Contractual Obligations

what happens when the value of something is not easily defined? What happens, for instance, when it takes a group of people to accomplish a certain task? How much does each of them contribute to the value the business adds to the product? The point is that how much an engineer is worth in a group cannot be pinned down by appealing to the free market.

The nature of control is now based on contractual obligations, which define the kind of work you will do and the standards that will govern it. ==Because I can’t specify in advance exactly what you will do from day to day, I must have a fair amount of generalized authority over your work. So you must give to me as part of the contract the right to monitor and evaluate and, if necessary, correct your work. We agree on other guidelines and work out rules that we will both obey.==

#### Cultural Values

When the ==environment changes more rapidly than one can change rules, or when a set of circumstances is so ambiguous and unclear that a contract between the parties that attempted to cover all possibilities would be prohibitively complicated==, we need another mode of control, which is based on cultural values. Its most important characteristic is that the interest of the larger group to which an individual belongs takes precedence over the interest of the individual himself.

When such values are at work, some emotionally loaded words come into play—words like trust —because you are surrendering to the group your ability to protect yourself. And for this to happen, you ==must believe that you all share a common set of values, a common set of objectives, and a common set of methods. These, in turn, can only be developed by a great deal of common, shared experience.==

![[hom9.png]]
It is our task as managers to identify which mode of control is most appropriate.

When a number of divisions share a common sales force, each of them has a vested interest to train representatives to promote and sell its products. At the same time, unless the divisions are willing to sacrifice self-interest in favor of the common interest, the training sessions can easily become disjointed free-for-alls and confuse everybody. So the need to have the individual divisions present coordinated messages is governed by corporate values. Thus, in field sales training, we find all three modes of control at work.

## IV The Players

### 11 The Sports Analogy

==When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. To determine which, we can employ a simple mental test: if the person’s life depended on doing the work, could he do it?==

==The single most important task of a manager is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates. So if two things limit high output, a manager has two ways to tackle the issue: through training and motivation==

![[hom10.png]]
A manager has two ways to improve performance: training and motivation.

![[hom11.png]]
Maslow defined a set of needs that tend to lie in a hierarchy: when a lower need is satisfied, one higher is likely to take over.

The physiological, safety/security, and social needs all can motivate us to show up for work, but other needs—esteem and self-actualization—make us perform once we are there.

At the lower levels of the motivation hierarchy, money is obviously important. It is needed to buy the necessities of life. Once there is enough money to bring a person up to a level he expects of himself, more money will not motivate.

==Money in the physiological- and security-driven modes only motivates until the need is satisfied, but money as a measure of achievement will motivate without limit==. Thus the second ten million can be just as important to the venture capitalist as the first, since it is not the utilitarian need for the money that drives him but the achievement that it implies, and the need for achievement is boundless.

==Once in the self-actualization mode, a person needs measures to gauge his progress and achievement. The most important type of measure is feedback on his performance==.

For the self-actualized person driven to improve his competence, the feedback mechanism lies within that individual himself. Our virtuoso violinist knows how the music should sound, knows when it is not right, and will strive tirelessly to get it right

What are some of the feedback mechanisms or measures in the workplace? The most appropriate measures tie an employee’s performance to the workings of the organization. If performance indicators and milestones in a management-by-objectives system are linked to the performance of the individual, they will gauge his degree of success and will enhance his progress

Given a specific task, fear of failure can spur a person on, but if it becomes a preoccupation, a person driven by a need to achieve will simply become conservative.

==In general, in the upper levels of motivation, fear is not something coming from the outside. It is instead fear of not satisfying yourself that causes you to back off. You cannot stay in the self-actualized mode if you’re always worried about failure==

Our society respects someone’s throwing himself into sports, but anybody who works very long hours is regarded as sick, a workaholic. So the prejudices of the majority say that sports are good and fun, but work is drudgery, a necessary evil, and in no way a source of pleasure.

Comparing our work to sports may also teach us how to cope with failure. As noted, one of the big impediments to a fully committed, highly motivated state of mind is preoccupation with failure. Yet we know that in any competitive sport, at least 50 percent of all matches are lost. All participants know that from the outset, and yet rarely do they give up at any stage of a contest.

==The role of the manager here is also clear: it is that of the coach. First, an ideal coach takes no personal credit for the success of his team, and because of that his players trust him. Second, he is tough on his team. By being critical, he tries to get the best performance his team members can provide. Third, a good coach was likely a good player himself at one time. And having played the game well, he also understands it well.==

### 12 Task-Relevant Maturity

Some researchers in this field argue that there is a fundamental variable that tells you what the best management style is in a particular situation. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a ==combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.==

The fundamental variable that determines the effective management style is the task-relevant maturity of the subordinate

A manager’s ability to operate in a style based on communication and mutual understanding depends on there being enough time for it. Though monitoring is on paper a manager’s most productive approach, we have to work our way up to it in the real world. Even if we achieve it, if things suddenly change we have to revert quickly to the what-when-how mode.

### 13 Performance Appraisal: Manager as Judge and Jury

==Giving performance reviews is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback we as supervisors can provide==. It is how we assess our subordinates’ level of performance and how we deliver that assessment to them individually. It is also how we allocate the rewards—promotions, dollars, stock options, or whatever we may use.

As we saw earlier, the review will influence a subordinate’s performance—positively or negatively—for a long time, which makes the appraisal one of the manager’s highest-leverage activities. In short, the review is an extremely powerful mechanism, and it is little wonder that opinions and feelings about it are strong and diverse.

==As managers, we are really called upon to judge performance, not just to see and record it when it’s in plain sight.==

Ultimately what you are after is the performance of the group, but the manager is there to add value in some way. You need to determine what that is. You must ask: Is he doing anything with his group? Is he hiring new people? Is he training the people he has, and doing other things that are likely to improve the output of the team in the future? The most difficult issues in determining a professional’s performance will be based on asking questions and making judgments of this sort.

==There are three L’s to keep in mind when delivering a review: Level, listen, and leave yourself out.==

You must level with your subordinate—the credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank. And don’t be surprised to find that praising someone in a straightforward fashion can be just as hard as criticizing him without embarrassment.

This is what I mean by listening: employing your entire arsenal of sensory capabilities to make certain your points are being properly interpreted by your subordinate’s brain.

The third L is “leave yourself out.

It is very important for you to understand that the performance review is about and for your subordinate. So your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or whatever should be kept out of it. At issue are the subordinate’s problems, not the supervisor’s, and it is the subordinate’s day in court

==The key is to recognize that your subordinate, like most people, has only a finite capacity to deal with facts, issues, and suggestions. You may possess seven truths about his performance, but if his capacity is only four, at best you’ll waste your breath on the other three.==

![[hom12.png]]
==The stages of problem-solving: The transition from blaming others to assuming responsibility is an emotional step.==

==In my experience, the best thing to do is to give your subordinate the written review sometime before the face-to-face discussion. He can then read the whole thing privately and digest it. He can react or overreact and then look at the “messages” again. By the time the two of you get together, he will be much more prepared, both emotionally and rationally.==

### 14 Two Difficult Tasks

#### Interviewing 

The purpose of the interview is to: 
•  select a good performer 
•  educate him as to who you and the company are 
•  determine if a mutual match exists 
•  sell him on the job

==The applicant should do 80 percent of the talking during the interview, and what he talks about should be your main concern. But you have a great deal of control here by being an active listener. Keep in mind you only have an hour or so to listen.==

Technical/Skills: describe some projects what are your weaknesses

What He Did With Knowledge: past achievements, past failures

Discrepancies: what did you learn from failures problems in current position

Operational Values: why are you ready for new job why should my company hire you why should engineer be chosen for marketing most important college course/project

==If you know the reference personally, you have a much better chance of getting “real” information. If you don’t, try to keep him on the phone long enough to let some sort of personal bond develop==

If possible, you should talk with the applicant again after you have checked his references, because you may have gotten some new perspectives. Such a follow-up interview can be quite a focused affair.

==Remember, a candidate is a potential employee. He will go away from having talked to you with a strong set of first impressions==. If those are wrong and you hire the person, it will take a long time before they change. So show yourself and your environment as they really are.

#### “I Quit!” 

This is what I most dread as a manager: a subordinate, highly valued and esteemed, decides to quit.

==In almost all such cases, the employee is quitting because he feels he is not important to you. If you do not deal with the situation right at the first mention, you’ll confirm his feelings and the outcome is inevitable.==

Drop what you are doing. Sit him down and ask him why he is quitting. Let him talk—don’t argue about anything with him.

Your subordinate is a valued employee—of the company. You now must vigorously pursue every avenue available to you to keep him with the firm, even if it means transferring him to another department.

==Other superior performers like him will track what happens to him, and their morale and commitment to the company will hinge on the outcome of this person’s fate==

### 15 Compensation as Task-Relevant Feedback

As managers, our concern is to get a high level of performance from our subordinates. So we want to dispense, allocate, and use money as a way to deliver task-relevant feedback. To do this, ==compensation should obviously be tied to performance, but that, as we’ve seen, is very hard to assess precisely.==

But compromises can be set up. We can base a portion of a middle manager’s compensation on his performance. Let’s call this a performance bonus. ==The percentage the bonus represents of a manager’s total compensation should rise with his total compensation==

For example, you might have a scheme in which a manager’s performance bonus is based on three factors. The first would include his individual performance only, as judged by his supervisor. The second would account for his immediate team’s objective performance, his department perhaps. The third factor would be linked to the overall financial performance of the corporation

![[hom7.png]]
There are two pure forms of salary administration; most companies use a compromise.

Promotions must be based on performance, because that is the only way to keep the idea of performance highlighted, maintained, and perpetuated.

![[hom8.png]]
An achiever will alternate between “meets requirements” and “exceeds requirements” ratings throughout his career.

If we take a person at point B and don’t offer him more work and greater challenges even though he “exceeds the requirements” of Job 1, we are not fully utilizing a human resource of the company. In time, he will atrophy, and his performance will return to a “meets requirements” level and stay there.

There are times when a person is promoted into a position so much over his head that he performs in a below-average fashion for too long a time. The solution is to recycle him: to put him back into the job he did well before he was promoted

management ought to face up to its own error in judgment and take forthright and deliberate steps to place the person into a job he can do. Management should also support the employee in the face of the embarrassment that he is likely to feel.

### 16 Why Training Is the Boss’s Job

In my view a manager’s output is the output of his organization—no more, no less. A manager’s own productivity thus depends on eliciting more output from his team.

A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in.

==For training to be effective, it has to be closely tied to how things are actually done in your organization.==

==For training to be effective, it also has to maintain a reliable, consistent presence==. Employees should be able to count on something systematic and scheduled, not a rescue effort summoned to solve the problem of the moment. In other words, training should be a process, not an event.

==Training must be done by a person who represents a suitable role model==. Proxies, no matter how well versed they might be in the subject matter, cannot assume that role. The person standing in front of the class should be seen as a believable, practicing authority on the subject taught.

If this is your first time teaching, you’ll discover a few interesting things:

- ==Training is hard work.== Preparing lectures and getting yourself ready to handle all the questions thrown at you is difficult. Even if you have been doing your job for a long time and even if you have done your subordinates’ jobs in great detail before, you’ll be amazed at how much you don’t know. Don’t be discouraged—this is typical. Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it. If you don’t believe me, try explaining to someone over the phone how to drive a stick-shift car.

- ==Guess who will have learned most from the course? You.== The crispness that developing it gave to your understanding of your own work is likely in itself to have made the effort extremely worthwhile.

- ==You will find that when the training process goes well, it is nothing short of exhilarating.== And even this exhilaration is dwarfed by the warm feeling you’ll get when you see a subordinate practice something you have taught him. Relish the exhilaration and warmth—it’ll help you to arm yourself for tackling the second course.

## One More Thing…

You have trusted me enough to buy my book and read it. Now let me say a final thing: if you do at least 100 points worth of what you find here, you’ll be a distinctly better manager for it.


#### Production

Identify the operations in your work most like process, assembly, and test production.

10

For a project you are working on, identify the limiting step and map out the flow of work around it.

10

Define the proper places for the equivalents of receiving inspection, in-process inspection, and final inspection in your work. Decide whether these inspections should be monitoring steps or gate-like. Identify the conditions under which you can relax things and move to a variable inspection scheme.

10

Identify half a dozen new indicators for your group’s output. They should measure both the quantity and quality of the output.

10

Install these new indicators as a routine in your work area, and establish their regular review in your staff meetings.

20

What is the most important strategy (plan of action) you are pursing now? Describe the environmental demand that prompted it and your current status or momentum. Is your strategy likely to result in a satisfactory state of affairs for you or your organization if successfully implemented?

20

#### Leverage

 

Conduct work simplification on your most tedious, time-consuming task. Eliminate at least 30 percent of the total number of steps involved.

10

Define your output: What are the output elements of the organization you manage and the organizations you can influence? List them in order of importance.

10

Analyze your information- and knowledge-gathering system. Is it properly balanced among “headlines,” “newspaper articles,” and “weekly news magazines”? Is redundancy built in?

10

Take a “tour.” Afterward, list the transactions you got involved in during its course.

10

Create a once-a-month “excuse” for a tour.

10

Describe how you will monitor the next project you delegate to a subordinate. What will you look for? How? How frequently?

10

Generate an inventory of projects on which you can work at discretionary times.

10

Hold a scheduled one-on-one with each of your subordinates. (Explain to them in advance what a one-on-one is about. Have them prepare for it.)

20

Look at your calendar for the last week. Classify your activities as low-/medium-/high-leverage. Generate a plan of action to do more of the high-leverage category. (What activities will you reduce?)

10

Forecast the demand on your time for the next week. What portion of your time is likely to be spent in meetings? Which of these are process-oriented meetings? Mission-oriented meetings? If the latter are over 25 percent of your total time, what should you do to reduce them?

10

Define the three most important objectives for your organization for the next three months. Support them with key results.

20

Have your subordinates do the same for themselves, after a thorough discussion of the set generated above.

20

Generate an inventory of pending decisions you are responsible for. Take three and structure the decision-making process for them, using the six-question approach.

10

Evaluate your own motivational state in terms of the Maslow hierarchy. Do the same for each of your subordinates.

10

Give your subordinates a racetrack: define a set of performance indicators for each.

20

List the various forms of task-relevant feedback your subordinates receive. How well can they gauge their progress through them?

10

Classify the task-relevant maturity of each of your subordinates as low, medium, or high. Evaluate the management style that would be most appropriate for each. Compare what your own style is with what it should be.

10

Evaluate the last performance review you received and also the last set of reviews you gave to your subordinates as a means of delivering task-relevant feedback. How well did the reviews do to improve performance? What was the nature of the communication process during the delivery of each?

20

Redo one of these reviews as it should have been done.

10
